DESCRIPTION

This program takes a word entered into a form and assigns a value to each letter.
The values are then totaled, and displayed to the user.

It is not a particularly friendly program.


SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

First, make sure Sinatra is on stage with your app.rb. Then open a web browser and go to:

http://localhost:4567/

There you will be prompted, somewhat challengingly, to enter your scrabble word
